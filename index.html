	<h1>About</h1>
	<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 1.5;">Not one person is the exact same. We're all unique! But why is that? Someone might answer "because we have different parents". Even though that is true, why are your parents different? Unlike humans, some animals don't have this ability to make children so different than themselves. For example, starfish clone themselves by popping off an arm that'll grow back into the entire animal. Why are we different?</p>

	<h1>About Creator: Thomas Spradling</h1>
	<p style="text-indent:0.5in; text-align: justify;">I am a senior in high school as of 2019, and have had the opportunity to perfect my skillsets in many different areas despite the small town I live in. I'm not too sure how many people will actually have the opportunity to see this webpage, but if you don't have a strong grasp on the process meiosis or are interested in learning about it, I'd recommend taking a look here. You won't learn a course-load of work, but you'll have a fine enough understanding to explain this topic to someone else because the tutorial was designed for an eight-grade audience. I actually had a lot fun doing this assignment, but of course it isn't one that'd get done out in the blue in vein. I created it for an AP&reg; Biology winter homework assignment, and if you happen to be someone not in that class, props for managing to find this! On this webpage, I gave credit where credit was due, so unless I specifically source an image, assume it belongs to me. Thank you for visiting.</p>
