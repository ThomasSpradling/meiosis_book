				<h1>DNA and Preparation</h1>
				<p>We are all made differently, and you already know that is because of some mysterious process called meiosis. The specific process of meiosis requires starting with one cell who will split up into four cells while moving DNA around in a special way. Before we can get too deep into that, we must talk a little bit about DNA, the building blocks of what makes you you!</p>
				<img src="Images/first.png">
				<span class="cpt">Our DNA is made up of sections called genes. Genes are responsible for our traits, for example one section of DNA might be responsible for eye color.</span>
				
				<h2 id="chromosomes-and-their-anatomy">Chromosomes and their Anatomy</h2>
				<p>When DNA coils up to get compact, it is usually in the form of <a class="bulk" href="../conclusion/index.html#chromatin">chromatin</a>. If you remember, that was when the DNA is bunched all over randomly. When it is time to perform meiosis; however, a cell forms the DNA into a <a class="bulk" href="../conclusion/index.html#chromosome">chromosome</a>, a more complicated combination.</p>
				<img src="Images/second.png">
				<span class="cpt">Anatomy of a Chromosome</span>
				<p>As you can see in the figure above, chromosomes are made up of compact DNA. DNA is made up of sections called <a class="bulk" href="../conclusion/index.html#gene">genes</a>. The place where a gene is located on the chromosome is a <a class="bulk" href="../conclusion/index.html#locus">locus</a> (<em>plural:</em> loci). In a central part of the chromosome, there is a ball of protein called a <a class="bulk" href="../conclusion/index.html#centromere">centromere</a>. It is important to note that all chromosomes have exactly one centromere.</p>
				<p>In one human cell, there are 46 chromosomes in the nucleus: 23 from your mom, 23 from your dad. When a cell has all 46 chromosomes, it has a "full set". Another name for a full set is <a class="bulk" href="../conclusion/index.html#diploid">diploid</a>, so you can say that humans have a diploid number of 46.</p>
				
				<img src="Images/fourth.png">
				<span class="cpt">Homologous pairs don't have to have the same exact genes, just the same type of genes.</span>
				<p>This also means that the chromosomes come in <a class="bulk" href="../conclusion/index.html#homologous">homologous</a> pairs, pairs of chromosomes that have the same types of genes in the same locations (again, one from each parent). Here is a picture of a <a class="bulk" href="../conclusion/index.html#karyotype">karyotype</a> that shows all 23 pairs.</p>

				<span class="cpt">A karyotype is a list of all the chromosomes in a cell. This is one of a human's cell. (Source: <em>https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Karyotype.png</em>)</span>

				<h2 id="interphase">Interphase</h2>
				<p>When a cell is going through its normal functions (breathing, growing, etc.) you can also say it is in <a class="bulk" href="../conclusion/index.html#interphase">interphase</a>. During the first parts of interphase, the nucleus still contains chromatin (DNA bunched up everywhere). But when a gametocyte is ready to go through meiosis, it will turn all the chromatin into the 46 chromosomes. The most important part of interphase is when the DNA of the chromosomes duplicates:</p>
				<img src="Images/fifth.png">
				<span class="cpt">A cell who's full set is equal to two. Remember this is an example cell; humans have 46.</span>
				
				<p>Notice that when a chromosome's DNA is duplicated, there adds another piece to the chromosome. Both the pieces, called <a class="bulk" href="../conclusion/index.html#chromatid">chromatids</a>, are formed around one centromere. Woah! That was a lot of crazy vocabulary! Make sure you scroll back up to remind yourself of anything, the endings are important!</p>
				<p>Now we are ready for meiosis, because your cell with two chromosomes (and four chromatids) has its full set duplicated.</p>
